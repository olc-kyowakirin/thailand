                <div class="box-text">
                    <p>Because of the international nature of our business, we may transfer your personal data within our group companies, and to third parties as noted in Section 4, in connection with the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. This may require that your personal data are ultimately transferred a destination outside of your country of residence. In this context, we will take appropriate measures such as obligating the third party to conduct appropriate security management through a data protection agreement.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 10px;">When your country of residence is EU/EEA or United Kingdom, depending on the way your personal data is processed, your personal data may also be transferred outside the EU/EEA or United Kingdom. In these cases, we ensure that an adequate level of data protection exists before transferring your personal data. This means that via EU or United Kingdom standard contractual clauses or an adequacy decision or other valid adequacy mechanism, a level of data protection is achieved that is comparable to the standards within the EU or United Kingdom. A copy of the relevant mechanism can be provided for your review on request by contacting us using the details set out below. </p>

Where we process personal data to meet legal requirements, we hold this for as long as the law requires. After we achieve the purpose for which your personal data was collected, we erase or dispose of it appropriately, or anonymize it so that it can no longer identify an individual, based on our rules for processing your personal data.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 10px;">Where we process personal data for marketing purposes or with your consent, we process the data until you ask us to stop and for a short period after this (to allow us to implement your requests). We also keep a record of the fact that you have asked us not to send you direct marketing or to process your data indefinitely so that we can respect your request in the future.</p>
